A project exploring pandas functionality through building an API to interact with Overwatch league player and map data with the end goal of performing data analysis with the help of machine learning algorithms - some of them coded from scratch.

The OWL data is available from https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab (DOWNLOAD THE DATA section)

Context

This project sprung from when I started watching esports a few years ago, which I have continued because they are very useful in giving short breaks in between work to let your mind recuperate.

The idea was first to perform some data cleaning and apply some machine learning algorithms (perhaps some basic ones hard coded myself) to various data that came from the Overwatch League in order to see if I could predict certain outcomes based on other data. When I loaded the data, I realised that a hell of a lot of data manipulation would be necessary to make the data really practical to perform analysis on so I thought it would be a good exercise to build an API.

Of course, an API isn't strictly necessary, I could have just processed the data into several more useful tables, and this would be more efficient computationally as well as I could keep referring back to those tables, but I just thought it would be a nice exercise.

I started this during summer 2021 but unfortunately my work rate dramtically slowed due to some health problems, I am now extremely busy with my course (mechanical engineering year 2 at imperial college).
